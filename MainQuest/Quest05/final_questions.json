I called out and ran after the bus, but it was too late. I felt a wave of disappointment wash over me as I realized that I would have to wait three hours for the next bus. I must have been visibly upset because a woman came over, took my arm, and led me to the street. She called a taxi and gave the driver a five­dollar bill. She told him to take me to the ferry terminal, because the bus made a stop there before heading out onto the highway. She also wished me a Merry Christmas, and all I could do was smile. I couldn’t believe what she had done for me, a complete stranger!",

Extensive reading is the principal key to expanding one’s knowledge and keeping up with developments in a discipline. However, what is often overlooked here is that scientists are also obliged to be skillful writers. Only the researcher who is competent in the art of written communication can play an active and effective role in contributing to science.” From the perspective of readability, moreover, scientists should always write with a reader­centered mentality; even in the act of writing they must be mindful of the act of reading. It would be beneficial for them to understand how readers read in order to improve their writing.",

Macroeconomists, however, have no laboratories and little ability to run economy­wide experiments of any kind. Granted, they can study different economies around the world, but each economy is unique, so comparisons are tricky. Controlled experiments also provide the natural sciences with something seldom available to economists — the chance, or serendipitous, discovery (such as penicillin). Macroeconomists studying the U.S. economy have only one patient, so they can’t introduce particular policies in a variety of alternative settings. You can’t squeeze economies into a test tube. Cries of “Eureka!” are seldom heard from macroeconomists. An economy consisting of hundreds of millions of individual actors is a complicated thing.

A sufficiently happy ending can change the meaning of all the previous events. They can all be viewed as worthwhile, given that ending. Now imagine another movie. A lot of things are happening. They’re all exciting and interesting. But there are a lot of them. Ninety minutes in, you start to worry. “This is a great movie,” you think, “but there are a lot of things going on. I sure hope the filmmaker can pull it all together.” But that doesn’t happen. Instead, the story ends, suddenly, unresolved, or something facile and clichéd occurs. You leave deeply annoyed and unsatisfied —failing to notice that you were fully engaged and enjoying the movie almost the whole time you were in the theatre.

[3점] \n \n Just as today some jobs are better than others, so would they have been in early societies with their blossoming towns and eventually cities, with some roles more dangerous and some having more plentiful access to food or other resources. The archeological record shows that soon after the appearance of towns, agriculture, and surpluses, some burials start to look different from others. Some individuals are buried with more precious goods (metals, weapons, and maybe even art), some are in group graves and some by themselves, and still others don’t even seem to be buried at all. The bones from the burials start to show us differences as well — chemical and isotope analyses of teeth and long bones reveal that some members of groups were getting more protein or minerals than others; some have more evidence of diseases and greater physical injuries from their labors. Early on these differences are small, but by 5,000 to 7,000 years ago they are becoming quite pronounced. \n * archeological: 고고학의  ** surplus: 잉여물  *** isotope: 동위 원소",

You wonder what you did wrong and what you might have done differently. Bonds can help us reach a more balanced perspective; there are some bonds that were simply never meant to last, even if they played an essential role in your evolution to this point. Perhaps the most valuable thing is to know that seeing bonds break doesn’t have to break us. In chemistry, by definition, a change in the atomic bonding is not just the end of one state, but the beginning of another: creating the space for new bonding potential. The same is true for us as humans. It might take a cup of warm milk to reset us and give us comfort after a relationship has broken down. But however many bonds we see come apart, we will always retain one of our most human abilities: to connect afresh, find new friends and love again.",
